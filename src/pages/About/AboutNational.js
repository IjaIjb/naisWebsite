          The Nigerian Army Intelligence School (NAIS) - History and Background
        </h3>

        <h5 className="text-[#626262] text-[16px] font-[400] ">
          The Nigerian Army Intelligence School (NAIS) has been at the forefront
          of providing specialized training in intelligence and security-related
          subjects since its establishment in April 1973. Originally known as
          the Nigerian Army School of Intelligence (NASI) and located at Tego
          Barracks, Apapa, the school underwent a name change in 1975 to NAIS,
          to distinguish it from the Nigerian Army School of Infantry (NASI) in
          Jaji and to prevent acronym duplication.<br /><br /> NAIS plays a vital role in
          equipping personnel from the Nigerian Armed Forces, Police, and
          various security establishments, including DSS, NDLEA, and NPA, with
          the necessary expertise in intelligence operations. The school is
          committed to upholding the training policies set by HQ NAIC, AHQ DAT,
          and HQ TRADOC, which focus on producing highly skilled intelligence
          professionals capable of managing intelligence at all levels and
          supporting NA CTCOIN Operations effectively.
